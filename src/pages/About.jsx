          Hello! I'm a dedicated and solutions-driven full stack 
          developer with a background in Information Technology and hands-on 
          experience in building real-world systems. I specialize in JavaScript, 
          React, Python, and cloud-based technologies, with a strong focus on 
          creating scalable, user-friendly web applications.

          Today, I specialize in JavaScript, React, Python, and cloud technologies,
          with a focus on building responsive, real-world solutions. My projects 
          include a warehouse management system deployed on AWS using Amazon Aurora,
          and a smart parking management system powered by YOLOv8 and OpenCV, both of
          which strengthened my skills in front-end and back-end development, 
          database design, and automation.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#555] mb-5 leading-[1.6]">
          In addition to programming, Iâ€™ve worked as a virtual assistant handling
          data entry, video editing, and web development using WordPress, and 
          I've implemented automations using tools like Excel VBA and 
          Microsoft Power Automate.
