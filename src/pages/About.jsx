          Hi! I'm a full stack developer with a background in Information Technology and real-world experience in building scalable, user-friendly web systems. I specialize in JavaScript, React, Python, and cloud-based technologies.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#555] mb-5 leading-[1.6]">
          Some of my recent projects include a warehouse management system hosted on AWS with Amazon Aurora, and a smart parking system powered by YOLOv8 and OpenCV. These projects deepened my skills in front-end and back-end development, database design, and automation.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#555] mb-5 leading-[1.6]">
          Outside of coding, Iâ€™ve worked as a virtual assistant handling data entry, video editing, and WordPress development. I also build workflow automations using Excel VBA and Microsoft Power Automate.
